# rescript-firebase

Firebase bindings for https://www.npmjs.com/package/firebase

## Installation

This project is not complete so I would recommend to just copy the `src/Firebase.res` bindings into your own project and take it from there. I do accept contributions if you've used something in your project which is currently missing.

## Sample

Create a new Firebase project in the [console](https://console.firebase.google.com).
Register your web app and copy over the firebaseConfig in `Sample.res`.
Make the default Cloud Firestore instance.
